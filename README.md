![Image description](/images/Roku-Flasback.jpg)

The Flashback app is part of the Roku streaming service. Subscribers can use this app to access three separate flashback categories: movies, television (tv) and music. Each of these three sections are comprised exclusively of entertainment from 1950, 1960, 1970, 1980, and 1990 respectively.
One of Flashback's main features is the differentiation of the user profile. Users are divided into two distinct categories; administrators (Parents) and Kids. Administrators(Parents) are able to control the content selected for kids category.
